-How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The best waty to ensure functionality and security is to create unit tests that together have a high coverage percentage and use parameters that are on the fringes of accpetability as well as suspected average responses. In addition, running dependency checks for vulnerabilities will help with security.

-How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Creating unit tests to make sure the program accomplishes a task that will fulfill the user's need will help with incorporation. When these tests pass, that shows the need is being met.

-How do I approach designing software?

I start by creating the base program (objects, services, etc) and then unit tests to make sure that the program accomplishes the needs that were laid out. If not, I then refactor the base code until they do. Now that I know how to do this as well, I will then run a dependency check and attempt to update libraries and refactor code as much as possible to eliminate vulnerabilities.
